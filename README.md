# Vrinda Store Annual Sales Report 2022

This project was created in Excel to analyze Vrinda Store's sales data for 2022 and provide insights for improving sales in 2023.

## Data Cleaning
The dataset was cleaned for null values and parameters that define other data in the column. After cleaning, the data analysis process was initiated.

## Data Analysis
- The formula `=IF([@Age]>=50,"Senior", IF([@Age]>=30,"Adult","Teenager"))` was used to define age groups.
- The formula `=TEXT([@Date],"MMMM")` was used to extract the month from the date column.
- The symbol "0.00,,"M" was used to change lakh to million in the sales data.

## Insights
The following insights were gained from the data analysis:
1. Most sales occurred in March.
2. Women made more purchases than men.
3. Most purchases were made online, indicating the importance of fast deliveries.
4. Top states with the highest sales were identified.
5. The age group with the highest involvement was determined, suggesting the development of a new scheme targeting that age group.
6. Amazon was the leading sales channel, indicating the need to increase the products available on the platform.

## Recommendations
To improve sales in 2023, the following recommendations are proposed:
1. Target women from top states by offering coupons on the top three sales sites.
2. Increase the product range available on Amazon.
