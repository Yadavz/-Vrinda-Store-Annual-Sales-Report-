The Vrinda Store Annual Sales Report 2022 was an Excel project that aimed to analyze Vrinda Store's sales data for the year 2022 and provide insights for improving sales in 2023. The project involved data cleaning, such as removing null values and defining parameters that affect other data in the column. Data analysis was performed using various Excel formulas to extract relevant information from the dataset. The insights gained from the analysis included the top sales month, the gender of customers, the sales channels used, and the top states with the highest sales. Based on these insights, the report recommended that Vrinda Store target women in the top states by offering coupons on the top three sales sites and increase the product range available on Amazon to improve sales in 2023.
